Privacy Policy & Terms of Service
Last Updated: 04/01, 2026

1. LEGAL DISCLAIMER & AGREEMENT
PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. By installing or using this Application (the "App"), you enter into a legally binding agreement with [Your Name/Company Name] ("Developer," "we," or "us"). If you do not agree to these terms, you must delete the App immediately. This App allows for the tracking of highly sensitive, intimate information. You acknowledge that you use this App at your own risk.

PART I: PRIVACY POLICY (GDPR & US COMPLIANT)
2. Data Governance: "Local-First" Model
This App follows a "Privacy-by-Design" principle.

Local Data (User-Controlled): All primary data regarding encounters, notes, poses, and exact GPS locations are stored locally on your device using AsyncStorage. We do not have access to this data.

Cloud Data (Optional): Only if you opt-in to "Friend Features" do we sync your username and UUID to Firebase (Google). No intimate data (encounters, notes, ratings) is ever uploaded.

3. Special Categories of Data (Sensitive Information)
Under GDPR Article 9 and US CPRA, the information you may record (intimate encounters) is classified as Sensitive Personal Information.

Lawful Basis: We process this data solely based on your Explicit Consent. By inputting this data, you are granting us permission to facilitate its storage on your device.

Purpose: The data is processed only to provide the tracking and mapping functionality you requested.

No Sale/Sharing: We do not sell your data. We do not use it for advertising or profiling.

4. Location Data & Third Parties
GPS: We use expo-location and react-native-maps. GPS coordinates are stored locally.

Third-Party Services: We use Google Firebase for optional authentication and Google Maps SDK for map rendering. These services process data according to their own privacy policies. We are not responsible for their data handling.

5. Your Rights (Global)
Regardless of your location, you have the following rights:

Right to Erasure: Deleting the App or using the "Clear Data" setting permanently deletes all local data. Cloud data can be deleted via the "Delete Account" button.

Right to Access: You have full access to your data through the App interface.

US Residents (CCPA/CPRA): You have the right to limit the use of your Sensitive Personal Information. Since all SPI is stored locally, you exercise this right by not inputting the data or deleting the App.

PART II: TERMS OF SERVICE & LIABILITY SHIELD
6. Limitation of Liability (The "Lawsuit Shield")
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE DEVELOPER OR PUBLISHER BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:

Data Breaches: Unauthorized access to your device or local storage.

Data Loss: Loss of data due to app bugs, OS updates, or device failure.

Privacy Leaks: Any disclosure of your intimate information resulting from your choice to share data with "Friends" or failing to secure your device.

Psychological or Physical Harm: Any distress or injury arising from the use of the App or the activities recorded therein.

OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU TO US (IF ANY), WHICH IS $0.00.

7. User Indemnification
You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Developer and Publisher from any and all lawsuits, claims, costs, or legal fees arising from:

Your use or misuse of the App.

Your violation of any third-party rights (e.g., recording data about a partner without their consent).

Any content you input or share through the Friend system.

8. No Warranty & Technical Risks
"As-Is": The App is provided "As-Is" without warranties of any kind.

Security: You acknowledge that this App does not use end-to-end encryption. Data security relies entirely on your device's native security (Passcode/Biometrics).

Third-Party Failure: We are not liable for any outages or data handling errors by Firebase or Google Maps.

9. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution
This agreement is governed by the laws of [Insert Your State/Country]. You agree that any legal action shall be brought exclusively in the courts of [Insert Your City/County], and you waive any right to a jury trial or class action participation.

10. CONSENT & ACKNOWLEDGMENT
By clicking "Accept" or using the App, you provide Explicit Consent for the processing of sensitive data and agree to the total waiver of liability for the Developer.
