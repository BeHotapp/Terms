2. Scope

This Privacy Policy explains how personal data is processed when you use the mobile application (the “App”).

3. Categories of data

Depending on features enabled, the App may process:

Sensitive personal data (Article 9 GDPR): user-entered information relating to sexual life or intimate encounters

Location data: GPS coordinates

Identifiers: username, UUID (only if Friend Features enabled)

Technical data: app version, OS version (limited, non-profiling)

4. Local-first processing

By default, all sensitive content and precise location data are stored locally on the user’s device. The Developer does not access this data as part of ordinary operation.

5. Optional cloud processing

If the user explicitly enables Friend Features:

Minimal identifiers (username, UUID) are transmitted to Google Firebase

No intimate content is uploaded unless explicitly selected by the user

Firebase acts as a data processor under a Data Processing Agreement.

Enable optional social features (if enabled)

Maintain app security and integrity

No advertising, profiling, or resale of sensitive data occurs.

7. Legal bases

Explicit consent (GDPR Art. 9(2)(a)) for sensitive data processing where applicable

Performance of a contract for basic app functionality

Legitimate interests for minimal security logging (where applicable)

8. Consent withdrawal

Users may withdraw consent at any time via in-app settings. Withdrawal does not affect prior lawful processing.

9. Data retention

Local data: until deleted by the user or app uninstalled

Cloud data: until account deletion or deletion request

10. User rights

Users have rights to access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, and complaint to a supervisory authority.

EU users may contact their local Data Protection Authority. Spanish authority: AEPD.

11. International transfers

Where data is processed outside the EEA, appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses are used.

12. Security

Reasonable technical and organizational measures are implemented, including encrypted transport, processor security standards, and reliance on device-level security.

The App is not intended for persons under 18. We do not knowingly process data of minors.
